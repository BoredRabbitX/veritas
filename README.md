# 🔗 VERITAS Protocol (V3.5.2)
### *Trust is On-Chain. Reviews are Eternal.*

**VERITAS** is a decentralized review protocol built on the **Paseo AssetHub** blockchain. It solves the "fake review" problem by mathematically linking every piece of feedback to a unique, on-chain cryptographic receipt issued by the merchant.

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Proof-of-Purchase:** Only customers with a valid, single-use Receipt ID can post a review. No receipt, no voice.
* **Immutable Transparency:** Reviews are stored as blockchain events—they cannot be deleted, hidden, or altered by merchants.
* **Dynamic Analytics:** Real-time calculation of average ratings and review counts directly from the blockchain logs.
* **High-End UI:** A professional "Glassmorphism" dark mode interface designed for readability and trust.
* **Merchant Hub:** Self-service dashboard for business registration and on-chain receipt generation.
